This is a trivia game based on Bingo. 

The game can be played with 2-n number of players. Each player is given a set of `x` number of options, of this set `n` options will be the answers to `n` questions in the round. But `n < x`, where `z` options are like poison-apples. If the player plays a poison apple, they will lose one point. For every correct option played against a question the player will gain 1 point. Clearly, the maximum score in a round is `n` points.

At the end of a round the person(s) with the most points wins the round.If there is a `tie` a new set of cards will be handed out to the remaining players and the game will continue until just one player remains.
